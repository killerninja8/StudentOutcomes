### Prerequisites
Minor Changes
Minor typos or grammatical errors in documentation can be corrected directly via the GitHub web interface, provided the changes are made in the source file.

### Other Changes
Prior to submitting a substantial pull request, initiate a discussion by opening an issue to present the proposed change to the team.
For bug reports, furnish a minimal reproducible example or reprex. Refer to Stack Overflow for more information.

### Pull Request and Merge
Create a new Git branch for each pull request (PR), necessitating approval from two members to merge.
Include DRY code and thorough tests, accounting for edge cases in new functionality. More details can be found at Real Python.
Update documentation after modifying files.

### Coding Style
Every member should craft a clear, concise, yet descriptive commit message, explaining the problem it solves or the object it creates/alters.
All new code must adhere to the PEP 8 style guide. Additional details are available here.
Consistency is crucial! Members are expected to maintain homogeneity in style, formatting, and naming conventions.
For effective commit messages, refer to these guidelines: Commit Messages.
