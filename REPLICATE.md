# Semi-Supervised Learning Analysis with xAPI-Edu-Data

Note: I'll do my best to make sure this analysis can be recrated by any other user. Details will be updated on the go. Thanks for understanding. 

## Step 1: Environment Setup
- **Python Libraries**: Ensure installation of `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `imbalanced-learn`, and `lightgbm`.

## Step 2: Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Load Dataset**: `data = pd.read_csv('xAPI-Edu-Data.csv')`
- **Data Summary**: Utilize `data.describe()` and `data.info()`.
- **Visualizations**: Create histograms and box plots for each numerical feature and bar plots for categorical features using `seaborn`.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Use `seaborn.heatmap()` to visualize correlations.

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Check with `data.isnull().sum()` and impute or remove as needed.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Apply `pd.get_dummies()` for one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Use `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.

## Step 4: Clustering Analysis
- **K-Means**: Apply `KMeans` from scikit-learn, determine optimal clusters via silhouette score.
- **DBSCAN**: Implement `DBSCAN` from scikit-learn with `eps=0.5`, `min_samples=5`.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Use `AgglomerativeClustering` with `n_clusters` as determined from K-Means.
- **Cluster Labeling**: Add cluster labels as a feature.

## Step 5: SMOTE for Imbalance
- **SMOTE Application**: Utilize `SMOTE` from the imbalanced-learn library on the labeled dataset.

## Step 6: Model Preparation
- **Split Data**: Use `train_test_split` for dividing data into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets.

## Step 7: LGBM Ensemble Model
- **Define LGBM Models**: Create several LGBM models with variations in hyperparameters and features in `lightgbm`.
- **Model Training**: Train each model on the training set using `lgb.train()`.
- **Ensemble Strategy**: Combine the predictions from each model, using techniques like averaging or a voting mechanism.

## Step 8: Training and Validation
- **Train Ensemble Model**: Use the augmented dataset for training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employ `GridSearchCV` for LGBM hyperparameters.

## Step 9: Model Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compute `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `f1_score`, and `roc_auc_score` from scikit-learn.
- **Test Set Validation**: Assess model performance on the test set.

## Step 10: Interpretability and Reporting
- **Feature Importance**: Analyze feature importance from the LGBM models.
- **Results Visualization**: Use `matplotlib` for plotting performance metrics and feature importance.
- **Documentation**: Write a report detailing methodology, findings, and interpretations.

## Step 11: Ethical Considerations and Bias
- **Bias Assessment**: Review model predictions for potential biases.
- **Ethical Discussion**: Reflect on the ethical implications of the analysis.

## Step 12: Conclusion and Future Directions
- **Summarize Findings**: Highlight key insights and conclusions.
- **Future Research**: Suggest potential future research directions based on your findings.
